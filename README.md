# 📑 **David Isumba - Portfolio Website** 

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a **responsive website** built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a web developer. The website is designed with modern web development practices to ensure it looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## 🌟 **Features**

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using CSS media queries.
- **Interactive UI**: JavaScript-powered animations and transitions provide a smooth, dynamic user experience.
- **Project Carousel**: A responsive carousel displaying two project images at a time, with smooth transitions on navigation.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Navigation between sections and elements happens smoothly with CSS and JavaScript.
- **Contact Form**: A functional contact section where users can reach out to me directly.
- **No Frameworks**: The website is built without any CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) or JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery). Everything is handcrafted for performance and customization.

## 📱 **Responsive Layout**

The website is designed to be fully responsive. Here's how the layout adjusts based on screen size:

- **Desktop Layout**: A multi-column design with navigation, projects, and contact sections laid out horizontally.
- **Tablet Layout**: Adjusts to a two-column design with stacked projects and responsive grid changes.
- **Mobile Layout**: Single-column layout for easy navigation on small screens. Buttons and text scale appropriately for smaller devices.

Media queries are used to change the layout and styling depending on the screen width, ensuring optimal display on all devices.
